Git Basics

Git is a version control system, which works like saving your progress when playing video games (e.g., GTA Vice City, GTA San Andreas, etc.).

Imagine you have a new project folder that you want to share with others for collaboration. To do this, you first need to enable version control for that folder, similar to how you'd insert a memory card in a game to save your progress. In Git, you do this by using the `git init` command, which turns your folder into a Git repository (i.e., it enables version control).

Once version control is set up, the `git add .` command tracks all the changes you make to the files in the folder. This is like taking snapshots of your progress in the game.

The `git commit` command takes those tracked changes and saves them to the current branch (or snapshot) of the project. This is like saving your progress at a certain level of the game.

Branches in Git are like separate game files where you can play from different levels. For example, if you’re working on a feature but don’t want to affect the main progress, you can create a branch (like a copy of your main progress). Your friend can then work on a different branch, completing their own tasks or levels.

If your friend finishes their task and wants to share their progress, they can submit a Pull Request (PR), similar to saying, “I’ve finished my part of the game; do you want to include it in your game?” As the project owner, you can review the changes and decide whether to merge them into your branch (main progress).

This helps in collaboration without overwriting each other’s work, and allows multiple people to work on the same project without interfering with each other’s progress.

Git Workflow
Git allows multiple people to work on a project at the same time by maintaining separate branches.
A branch is like a parallel universe where you can make changes without affecting the main code.
Commit: It's like taking a snapshot of your progress, saving the current state of your project.
Pull Request (PR): Once you’re done with a feature or fix, you can submit a PR to merge your changes into the main branch.
